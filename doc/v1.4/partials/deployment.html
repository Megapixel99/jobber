  <h2>Deployment</h2>

  <p itemprop="requirements">
    Jobber is written in <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>, and it should be
    possible to compile and run it on <span itemprop="operatingSystem">any
      Unix/Linux system</span>.
  </p>

  <aside class="alert alert-warning">
    <h4 class="alert-heading">Warning</h4>
    Privilege-escalation is possible if the OS on which Jobber runs allows
    non-root users to change the owner of a file to another user. Fortunately,
    this is not possible in Linux and is not common in other kinds of Unix.

  <h3>Installation from a Package</h3>

  <p>
    The easiest way to install Jobber is via <a href="/jobber/download">a
      binary package</a>.
  </p>

  <h3>Compilation and Installation from Source</h3>

  <p>Instead of installing a binary package, you can certainly compile and
    install Jobber yourself.</p>

  <p>A Jobber installation consists of four files:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><code>jobber</code>: a command-line program</li>
    <li><code>jobberrunner</code>: a per-user daemon that runs jobs</li>
    <li><code>jobbermaster</code>: a daemon that runs as root and controls all the
      <code>jobberrunner</code> instances</li>
    <li><code>jobber.conf</code>: a YAML config file</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To build, you first need a recent version of Go. Next:</p>

  <pre>git clone https://github.com/dshearer/jobber.git
cd jobber
git checkout v1.4.4
make</pre>

  <p>The results will be put in a directory named &ldquo;bin&rdquo;.</p>

  <p>To install Jobber:</p>

  <pre>sudo make install</pre>

  <p>You can change where the four files are installed by first running
    <code>./configure</code> (do <code>./configure -h</code> for the syntax)
  and then:</p>

  <pre>make clean
make build
sudo make install</pre>

  <p>
    Finally, do something to ensure that <code>jobbermaster</code> runs as a daemon (as root)
    when your computer boots. Note that jobbermaster does not daemonize itself,
    but that should not be a problem if you use systemd; otherwise, <a
      href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/daemonize">daemonize(1)</a> could help.
